<p>PBackup is a backup program for PBase photos. The owner of a PBase account can back up the original
  version of his photos as stored in PBase, including their title, description etc.</p>

<p>Here are some of the features:</p>

<ul>
<li>The user can choose which galleries to back up.</li>
<li>On the first run, all photos are backed up. Next runs back up newly added photos.
 It is possible to request that all photos are checked for changes and backed up if necessary.</li>
<li>Settings persist from an execution to the other.</li>
<li>Photos are stored in a directory tree similar to the gallery tree.
  The information attached to photos (title, description etc.) is stored as a file in the gallery directory (a JSON file).</li>
<li>The program tries to be nice to PBase servers, downloading only what is necessary
  to back up, and doing so one photo at a time.</li>
</ul>
